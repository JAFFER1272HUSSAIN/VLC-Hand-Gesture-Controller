# VLC Hand Gesture Controller 🎥✋

A computer vision project that lets you control VLC Media Player using **hand gestures** through your webcam. Built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and VLC Python bindings.

## 🚀 Features

- 👋 **Hand Detection** via webcam
- 🎵 **Play/Pause** using 0 or 1 finger
- ⏭️ **Next Track** with 2 fingers
- 🔊 **Increase Volume** with 5 fingers
- 🔉 **Decrease Volume** with 4 fingers
- ❌ **Close** VLC with 3 fingers
- 📊 **Live UI** showing current command and finger count

## 🧠 How it Works

This project uses:
- **MediaPipe** to detect and track your hand
- **OpenCV** to access your webcam and draw on the screen
- **VLC Python** API to control the VLC player
- **Custom gesture recognition logic** to detect number of fingers shown

Each number of fingers maps to a specific command (see below).

## ✋ Hand Gestures Map

| Fingers | Action          |
|---------|------------------|
| 0       | Pause            |
| 1       | Play             |
| 2       | Next Track       |
| 3       | Exit VLC         |
| 4       | Decrease Volume  |
| 5       | Increase Volume  |

> Make sure your hand is fully visible in front of the webcam.
